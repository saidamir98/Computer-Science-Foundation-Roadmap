- **Projects**:
    - [ ]  **Implement a Basic Hash Table:** Your goal is to create a simple hash table from scratch. Design and implement a class called `HashTable` that supports the following basic operations:
        - **Insertion (`insert`):** Implement a method to insert a key-value pair into the hash table. If the key already exists, update the corresponding value.
        - **Retrieval (`get`):** Implement a method to retrieve the value associated with a given key. If the key is not found, return a designated value indicating absence (e.g., `None` or `null`).
        - **Deletion (`delete`):** Implement a method to delete a key-value pair from the hash table based on the provided key.
        - **Collision Handling:** Implement a collision resolution mechanism, such as chaining (using linked lists for each bucket) or open addressing (linear probing, quadratic probing, etc.).
        - **Resizing:** Implement a mechanism to dynamically resize the hash table when the load factor (the ratio of the number of elements to the number of buckets) exceeds a certain threshold.
        - Constraints and Guidelines:
            - Choose an appropriate hashing function based on the type of keys you plan to support.
            - Ensure that your hash table can handle collisions efficiently.

        - Bonus (Optional):
            - Implement additional features like iterating through the key-value pairs, checking if a key exists in the hash table, or clearing the entire hash table.
            - Feel free to implement this task in the programming language of your choice, and don't forget to include comments or documentation to explain your implementation decisions.

- [Bash in 100 Seconds](https://youtu.be/I4EWvMFj37g)
- [Shell Scripting Crash Course - Beginner Level](https://youtu.be/v-F3YLd6oMw)

- **Projects**:
    - [ ]  **Generate Script from Command History with Progress Echo:**
        1. **Objective:**
            - Transform the sequence of commands in `history.txt` into a shell script (`script.sh`) with added `echo` statements to display progress.
        2. **Procedure:**
            - Open the `history.txt` file and carefully review the commands.
            - Create a new file named `script.sh`.
            - Copy and paste the commands from `history.txt` into `script.sh`.
            - Add `echo` statements before each command to provide visual progress indications.
            - Adjust the script to run from anywhere
        3. **Script Example:**
            - Here is an example template for `script.sh` with added `echo` statements:
                ```bash
                #!/bin/bash
                
                # Displaying current progress
                echo "Creating 'foo' directory on Desktop..."
                mkdir ~/Desktop/foo
                
                # Displaying current progress
                echo "Creating 'bar' directory inside 'foo'..."
                cd ~/Desktop/foo
                mkdir bar
                
                # Displaying current progress
                echo "Creating 'path.txt' and inserting absolute path..."
                echo "$(cd ~/Desktop/foo/bar && pwd)" > path.txt
                
                # (Repeat for each command)
                
                # Displaying final progress
                echo "Script execution completed!"
                ```
        4. **Execution:**
            - Save the `script.sh` file to a Desktop folder.
            - Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing `script.sh`.
            - Make the script executable with `chmod +x script.sh`.
            - Run the script with `./script.sh`.
            - Observe the echoed progress messages for each step in the terminal.
        5. **Notes:**
            - Adjust the script as needed, especially if there are specific considerations or modifications required for your environment.
            - The `echo` statements help visualize the execution progress of each command.
    
    - [ ]  **Captures screenshots of your screen**
        - **Objective:** Write a bash script named [screenshot.sh](http://screenshot.sh/) that captures screenshots of your screen at regular intervals specified by the user through terminal input. Save each screenshot with a unique timestamped filename (e.g., "Screen Shot 2022-03-28 at 17.48.06.jpg"). Organize these screenshots into folders named based on the date of each screenshot. If the folder for a specific date doesn't exist, the script should create it. Additionally, the script should place the folders in a central directory named "screenshot data" located next to the script file.
        - **Detailed Steps:**
            1. **User Input:**
                - The script should prompt the user to input the time interval (in seconds) for taking screenshots.
            2. **Folder Structure:**
                - Check if a folder named "screenshot data" exists next to the script. If not, create it.
                - Each screenshot should be saved in a folder named with the current date (e.g., "2022-03-28").
                - If the folder for the current date doesn't exist, create it.
            3. **Screenshot Capture:**
                - Continuously capture screenshots at the specified interval.
                - Save each screenshot with a filename in the format "Screen Shot YYYY-MM-DD at HH.MM.SS.jpg".
            4. **Script Location:**
                - Ensure the script works regardless of where it is executed from, considering relative paths.
            5. **Timestamp Format:**
                - Use the timestamp of each screenshot to format the folder name and individual screenshot filenames.
            6. **Script Output:**
                - Display informative messages during execution, such as confirming the creation of folders, capturing screenshots, and the location where the screenshots are stored.
        - **Example Script Execution:**
            ```bash
            # User input for time interval
            Enter the time interval for taking screenshots (in seconds): 60
            
            # Script output during execution
            Creating folder: screenshot data
            Creating folder: 2022-03-28
            Capturing screenshot: Screen Shot 2022-03-28 at 17.48.06.jpg
            Capturing screenshot: Screen Shot 2022-03-28 at 17.49.06.jpg
            ...
            ```
        - **Script Usage:**
            1. Save the script as `screenshot.sh`.
            2. Make it executable with `chmod +x screenshot.sh`.
            3. Run the script with `./screenshot.sh`.
